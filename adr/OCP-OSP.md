# ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORDS FOR: OpenShift Container Platform - OpenStack platform installation specificities

## OCP-OSP-01

**Title**
OCP installation method on OSP infrastructure

**Architectural Question**
Which OCP installation method will be used to deploy a cluster on OpenStack infrastructure?

**Issue or Problem**
The choice of installation method for OpenStack impacts the level of automation and integration with OpenStack services like Neutron, Cinder, and Nova.

**Assumption**
N/A

**Alternatives**

- User-Provisioned Infrastructure (UPI)
- Installer-Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI)

**Decision**
#TODO: Document the decision for the OpenStack cluster.#

**Justification**

- **User-Provisioned Infrastructure (UPI):** The user manually provisions the necessary OpenStack resources (VMs, networks, load balancers, security groups) before using the installer to deploy OpenShift. Provides maximum customization.
- **Installer-Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI):** Recommended for maximum integration. The OpenShift installer automatically provisions and manages the cluster infrastructure within OpenStack, leveraging Nova, Neutron, and Cinder APIs.

**Implications**

- **User-Provisioned Infrastructure (UPI):** High administrative overhead for setup and Day 2 scaling. Customization benefits must outweigh ongoing management complexity.
- **Installer-Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI):** Simplifies installation and uses the Machine API for dynamic scaling and lifecycle management of nodes. Requires comprehensive OpenStack credentials with provisioning permissions.

## OCP-OSP-02

**Title**
OpenStack Project Tenancy

**Architectural Question**
How will the OpenShift cluster resources be isolated within the OpenStack platform?

**Issue or Problem**
The OpenShift cluster (control plane, compute nodes) will consume OpenStack resources (VMs, volumes, networks, ports). A decision must be made on how to isolate these resources from other tenants and projects within OpenStack.

**Assumption**
N/A

**Alternatives**

- Single OpenStack Project
- Dedicated OpenStack Project per Cluster

**Decision**
#TODO: Document the decision for the OpenStack cluster.#

**Justification**

- **Single OpenStack Project:** To co-locate the OpenShift cluster resources within an existing, shared OpenStack project. This may be done to share quotas or network resources with other (non-OCP) applications.
- **Dedicated OpenStack Project per Cluster:** To create a new, dedicated OpenStack project for each OpenShift cluster (e.g., ocp-prod-project, ocp-nonprod-project). This is the recommended approach for isolation.

**Implications**

- **Single OpenStack Project:** Requires careful management of OpenStack quotas (vCPU, RAM, Cinder volumes) to prevent the OCP cluster from consuming all resources or being starved by "noisy neighbors" in the same project.
- **Dedicated OpenStack Project per Cluster:** Provides a clear boundary for security, quota management, and chargeback. It ensures the OpenShift cluster's resources are managed independently, which is critical for production stability.

## OCP-OSP-03

**Title**
OpenStack Storage Integration

**Architectural Question**
How will OpenShift integrate with OpenStack's storage services (Cinder and Manila) for application persistent volumes?

**Issue or Problem**
The cluster needs to integrate with the OpenStack cloud provider to provision persistent storage for applications. This requires configuring OCP to communicate with the correct Cinder (block) and/or Manila (file) backends using their respective CSI drivers. This decision is separate from any ODF deployment.

**Assumption**
Applications requiring persistent storage will be deployed. The OpenStack environment has Cinder and potentially Manila services available.

**Alternatives**

- Cinder CSI Driver (Block Storage)
- Manila CSI Driver (File Storage)
- Both Cinder and Manila CSI Drivers

**Decision**
#TODO: Document the decision for each cluster.#

**Justification**

- **Cinder CSI Driver (Block Storage):** To provide persistent block storage (RWO - ReadWriteOnce access mode) suitable for databases and single-pod consumer workloads. This is the most common integration.
- **Manila CSI Driver (File Storage):** To provide shared, distributed file storage (RWX - ReadWriteMany access mode) suitable for multi-pod consumer workloads requiring shared filesystem access (e.g., collaborative tools, web content).
- **Both Cinder and Manila CSI Drivers:** To offer a comprehensive range of native OpenStack storage solutions, supporting applications requiring both dedicated block storage and shared file capabilities.

**Implications**

- **Cinder CSI Driver:** Provisioning is restricted to ReadWriteOnce access mode. Requires careful selection and configuration of Cinder volume types within OpenStack to meet desired performance characteristics (e.g., SSD vs. HDD backing).
- **Manila CSI Driver:** Requires a fully configured, available, and performant Manila service backend within the OpenStack environment. Performance and reliability depend entirely on the Manila share provider configuration.
- **Both Cinder and Manila CSI Drivers:** Increases the number of storage options available but also requires managing the installation and lifecycle of two distinct CSI driver operators within OpenShift.
